            <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Brian Warner. I am 30 years old originally from Simi Valley, CA. I now live in
                Capo Beach, CA. I am currently enrolled in the Trilogy Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp at UCI. I want to be a developer because I have always loved technology and making really cool things.
                My favorite thing about technology and applications is that they help make people's lives easier.
                I am very interested in the backend part of development and would one day like to work on video games.

            </p>
            <p> Please go to the portfolio tab to see some of the projects I have made. 
                The link below is also to a group project I worked on called Samurai Unicorn. It is a search engine for video games using the giantbomb.com and twitch API's.
                My main roll in this project was working with the Twitch API.
            </p>
